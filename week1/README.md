## Counting Occurrences in a Python List - Sparse Array Problem

In Python, you can use the `count()` method to count the number of occurrences of a specific element within a list. Here's an example:

```python
arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
count_of_b = arr.count('b')
print(count_of_b)  # This will output 1, as 'b' appears once in the list 'arr'.

## Lonely Integer - Explanation

use the XOR operation, each element of array 

```python

unique = 0 #initialize
for num in arr:
	unique ^= num
return unique
