## Time Conversion Problem 

In Python package datetime import. 


## Counting Occurrences in a Python List - Sparse Array Problem

In Python, you can use the `count()` method to count the number of occurrences of a specific element within a list. Here's an example:

```python
arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
count_of_b = arr.count('b')
print(count_of_b)  # This will output 1, as 'b' appears once in the list 'arr'.

## Lonely Integer - Explanation

use the XOR operation, each element of array 

```python

unique = 0 #initialize
for num in arr:
	unique ^= num
return unique

## Flipping Bits Problem
```python

def flippingBits(n):
    # Create a binary string with leading zeros and flip the bits
    flipped_string = ''.join(['1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in f"{n:032b}"])

    # Convert the flipped binary string to an integer
    flipped_value = int(flipped_string, 2)

    return flipped_value

first create n integer number convert to string then integer array
after that flip 0 -> 1 & 1 -> 0 map, convert to 2byte integer

## Counting sort Problem
The countingSort function counts how many times each integer appears in the given array.

arr = [1,4,3,666,3,2,1] 
output is: result = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1] etc.

## Pangram Problem
The sentence contains all English alphabets, making it a pangram.

## Permute two Arrays Problem
from input arrays and some integers gets in function. 
must be read constraints and explanation ty

## Subarray Division 1 Problem
Lily and Ron want to share a chocolate bar. The chocolate bar consists of squares, and each square has a number on it. Ron's birth month is represented by the variable m, and his birth day is represented by the variable d.

Lily wants to break the chocolate bar into segments of length m, and she wants to do it in a way that the sum of the numbers on the squares in each segment equals Ron's birth day d.

For example, let's say the chocolate bar is [2, 2, 1, 3, 2], Ron's birth day is 4, and his birth month is 2. Lily wants to find all possible ways to break the chocolate bar into segments of length 2 where the sum of the numbers in each segment equals 4. In this case, there are two such ways:

She can choose the first two squares with numbers [2, 2], and their sum is 4.
She can choose the last two squares with numbers [3, 2], and their sum is also 4.
So, the function birthday should find and return the number of ways Lily can divide the chocolate bar into segments of length m where the sum of the numbers in each segment is equal to d. In this example, the function should return 2 because there are two valid ways to do so.
